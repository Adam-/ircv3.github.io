# IRCv3 Website

This is the IRCv3 website.

## Testing

If you want to test your changes to this website locally before submitting a pull request (always a good idea), here are the steps:

1. Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
2. Install `jekyll-sitemap` with `gem install jekyll-sitemap`
3. `git clone` this repository
4. `cd ircv3.github.io/`
5. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
6. `jekyll serve`

After you finish those steps, you will be able to go to [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) and view a local copy of the website. As you make changes to your files, they will be reflected on that local copy.
