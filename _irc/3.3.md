title: IRCv3.3
---

IRCv3.3 represents the next client protocol version.  We are currently accepting new extensions and the protocol is in a very experimental state.

The IRCv3 Working Group maintains a registry of "work-in-progress" extensions that have not yet been accepted as part of an IRC protocol version. IRC software vendors may provide additional extensions that have not yet been added to this registry. We recommend that extensions not in the registry use appropriate namespacing as described in the capability negotiation specification and in the message tags specification.

To submit an extension to the extension registry, please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html) via IRC for now (`irc.freenode.net #ircv3`). Extension specifications should be submitted in Markdown format.

<warn>
    <p>IRCv3.3 is a work-in-progress and may have major incompatibility changes without warning.</p>
    <p>These specifications may change at any time and we do not recommend implementing them in production environments.</p>
