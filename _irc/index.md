title: IRCv3 Specifications

### IRCv3.1

Right now the IRCv3 specification is distributed as a series of extension specifications to IRC protocol version 2.7, also known as [RFC1459](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459). To understand the basis of the IRC version 3 protocol, please read RFC1459 followed by the extension specifications.

Each version of IRCv3 contains base extensions, which comprise the core functionality of the IRC version 3 client protocol, and optional extensions, which comprise the extended functionality of the protocol.

This is the current stable version of the IRC protocol.  Errata updates may be submitted for the specifications.

### IRCv3.2

This is the most recent version of the IRC protocol.  We are accepting errata updates for this specification.  Client and server implementations of IRCv3.2 are still under development.  The IRCv3.2 protocol will replace 
IRCv3.1 as the stable release as an increasing amount of software is compliant with it.

Like the previous release, the current specifications are a series of changes from pre-existing protocols, in this case RFC1459 and 3.1.  We plan to release a unified specification draft based on the 3.2 protocol.

### IRCv3.3

IRCv3.3 represents the next client protocol version.  We are currently accepting new extensions and the protocol is in a very experimental state.

To submit an extension to the extension registry, please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact.html) via IRC for now (`irc.freenode.net #ircv3`). Extension specifications should be submitted in Markdown format.

The specifications here are listed purely for informational purposes and may change at any time.

This is an unreleased version of the IRC protocol.
