# Working group charter

---

The IRCv3 working group is chartered to prototype, develop, test and specify further extensions to
the IRC client protocol. It does not define any other aspect of an IRC network, such as IRC services,
or the server-to-server protocol, although the changes it develops may require cooperation from vendors
in both areas.

These extensions are published on this website through backwards-compatible [specifications](/irc/).


## Technical board

The direction of these specifications is led by the technical board. The board consists of a broad range of IRC software and specification authors that reflect the community at large. The board will seek to make all decisions by consensus.

Nominations for new members of the board will be considered according to the following criteria

 * Demonstrated support and adoption of the IRCv3 specifications
 * Developers of widely used IRC software
 * Administrators of IRC networks with at least 1,000 active peak users
 * People who have otherwise contributed materially to the specifications
 * Approval from the existing board
 * Adherence to the [code of conduct](/conduct.html)

We're seeking representation from as many members of the IRC community as possible. If you or your project would be a good candidate for representation, please contact the board. The current members of the board are:

The chair has ultimate responsibility for moving discussions forward and will make decisions in cases where consensus isn't possible, including returning proposals to the drawing board where necessary.
